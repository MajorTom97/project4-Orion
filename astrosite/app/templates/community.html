                        <p>Astronomers often spend their time lost among the stars, but astronomy and stargazing are also communal affairs.

From clubs and <a href="/astronomy-resources/astronomy-questions-answers/whats-up-at-star-parties">star parties</a> to public outreach and <a href="/pro-am-collaboration">pro-am collaboration</a>, here’s where you'll find a way to get involved.
